# Twitter Mods
Some style modifications for using Twitter on web browsers.

## Old-Twitter.css
You can give this CSS file to Safari Web browser while using the legacy version of Twitter for the Web, this will change the font to the one more commonly used on your system. Most importantly, it will get rid of Arial font style for Persian text.

## New-Twitter.css
This one is highly experimental because Twitter's new Web App may change soon, but so far it will reduce the width of the sidebar, makes some font sizes smaller, and adds space below the messages window therefore the message box where you type isn't at the bottom of the window.

## How to apply to Safari
- Safari -> Preferences.
- Advanced.
- Set the Stylesheet to one of the above CSS files.
